 abstract = {The goal of this study was to evaluate whether ultrasonic velocities in cortical bone can be considered as a proxy for mechanical quality of cortical bone tissue reflected by porosity and compression strength. Micro-computed tomography, compression mechanical testing and resonant ultrasound spectroscopy were used to assess, respectively, porosity, strength and velocity of bulk waves of both shear and longitudinal polarisations propagating along and perpendicular to osteons, in 92 cortical bone specimens from tibia and femur of elderly human donors. All velocities were significantly associated with strength (r = 0.65–0.83) and porosity (r = –0.64 to –0.77). Roughly, according to linear regression models, a decrease in velocity of 100 m/s corresponded to a loss of 20 MPa in strength (which is approximately 10% of the largest strength value) and to an increase in porosity of 5%. These results provide a rationale for the in vivo measurement of one or several velocities for the diagnosis of bone fragility.},
